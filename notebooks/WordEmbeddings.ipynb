    "with shape `(samples, time, features)` and also returns similarly-shaped 3D tensors. The convolution window is a 1D window on the temporal \n",
    "axis, axis 1 in the input tensor.\n",

    "1D convnets are structured in the same way as their 2D counter-parts that you have used in Chapter 5: they consist of a stack of `Conv1D` \n",
    "and `MaxPooling1D` layers, eventually ending in either a global pooling layer or a `Flatten` layer, turning the 3D outputs into 2D outputs, \n",
    "allowing to add one or more `Dense` layers to the model, for classification or regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference, though, is the fact that we can afford to use larger convolution windows with 1D convnets. Indeed, with a 2D convolution \n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you should take away from this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There's usually quite a bit of preprocessing you need to do on your raw data in order to be able to feed it -- as tensors -- into a neural \n",
    "network. In the case of sequences of words, they can be encoded as binary vectors -- but there are other encoding options too.\n",
    "* Stacks of `Dense` layers with `relu` activations can solve a wide range of problems (including sentiment classification), and you will \n",
    "likely use them frequently.\n",
    "* In a binary classification problem (two output classes), your network should end with a `Dense` layer with 1 unit and a `sigmoid` activation, \n",
    "i.e. the output of your network should be a scalar between 0 and 1, encoding a probability.\n",
    "* With such a scalar sigmoid output, on a binary classification problem, the loss function you should use is `binary_crossentropy`.\n",
    "* The `rmsprop` optimizer is generally a good enough choice of optimizer, whatever your problem. That's one less thing for you to worry \n",
    "about.\n",
    "* As they get better on their training data, neural networks eventually start _overfitting_ and end up obtaining increasingly worse results on data \n",
    "never-seen-before. Make sure to always monitor performance on data that is outside of the training set.\n",
