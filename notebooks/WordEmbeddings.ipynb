    "\n",
    "In Keras, you would use a 1D convnet via the `Conv1D` layer, which has a very similar interface to `Conv2D`. It takes as input 3D tensors \n",
    "with shape `(samples, time, features)` and also returns similarly-shaped 3D tensors. The convolution window is a 1D window on the temporal \n",
    "axis, axis 1 in the input tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a simple 2-layer 1D convnet and apply it to the IMDB sentiment classification task that you are already familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "1D convnets are structured in the same way as their 2D counter-parts that you have used in Chapter 5: they consist of a stack of `Conv1D` \n",
    "and `MaxPooling1D` layers, eventually ending in either a global pooling layer or a `Flatten` layer, turning the 3D outputs into 2D outputs, \n",
    "allowing to add one or more `Dense` layers to the model, for classification or regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference, though, is the fact that we can afford to use larger convolution windows with 1D convnets. Indeed, with a 2D convolution \n",
    "layer, a 3x3 convolution window contains 3*3 = 9 feature vectors, but with a 1D convolution layer, a convolution window of size 3 would \n",
    "only contain 3 feature vectors. We can thus easily afford 1D convolution windows of size 7 or 9.\n",
